# TypeScript_Calculator
I have completed the Typescript practical's Calculator And I also getting Input from Keyboard i.e., number and arithmetic operator(+, -, *, /) using ascii value. I used keyCode method to get the Ascii value of each keypress.

I also know the another method of doing this this using array, but making array will increase the time complexity, such that we have to traverse the array each time for each keypress and it also increase space Complexity. So, I used ascii value method for this.

And when I compile my Typescript code I did not get eny error in terminal.
